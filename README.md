## üêæ About Meow-tasploit

Meow-tasploit is an interactive, cat-themed command-line interface (CLI) framework designed for cybersecurity professionals. It aims to be an analyst's primary console for managing the entire lifecycle of security engagements, from reconnaissance and data organization to vulnerability management and reporting. With a focus on a delightful and engaging user experience, Meow-tasploit helps you pounce on data and claw your way through complex assessments!
